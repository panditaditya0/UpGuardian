## 🧠 AI-Powered Monitoring

### 🔮 Predictive Failure Detection
- ML-based models analyze uptime trends to forecast API or service outages before they happen.

### 📊 Anomaly Detection
- Detect spikes or unusual behavior in:
  - API latency
  - System metrics
  - Heartbeat delays
  - SSL changes

### 🧠 Smart Alerting
- Reduces noise and learns from user inputs.
- Adaptive thresholds based on past data.

### 📉 Downtime Forecasting
- Projects potential outages based on performance history.

### 💡 Root Cause Suggestions *(experimental)*
- Suggests likely causes for detected failures by analyzing correlated metrics.

## 📊 Monitoring Modules

### 🔍 REST API Monitoring
- Health checks for endpoints with configurable HTTP method, payloads, and headers.
- Logs status codes, response time, and body (optional).
- Dashboard with filters and charts.

### 🖥️ Server Uptime (Heartbeats)
- Tracks services with pings or custom endpoints.
- Displays uptime %, downtime streaks, and last seen.

### 🔒 SSL Certificate Checker
- Monitors domains for certificate expiry.
- Alerts you before expiration to prevent HTTPS failures.

### 🧾 Invoice Payment Alerts
- Monitors invoice due dates and payment statuses.
- Can sync with billing APIs or internal systems.

### 🐳 Docker Microservices
- Uses Docker API to track:
  - Container restarts
  - Healthcheck failures
  - Resource spikes (CPU/memory)

### 🧩 Database Monitoring
- Tracks query latency, connection health, and blocking queries.
- Supports JDBC-compatible databases.

### 🌐 DNS & Outbound API Monitoring
- Verifies DNS resolution and third-party API availability.
- Monitors services your app depends on.

### 🔁 Queue Monitoring
- Kafka, RabbitMQ support.
- Detects lag, high throughput, or stuck queues.
